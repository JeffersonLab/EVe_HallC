EVe_HallC is an event display program for the Hall C HMS detector stack.

Some documentation may be found in the Docs/ directory, however it has not
kept pace with some of the modifications so YMMV.

This code is based off an event display originally written by Miha Mihovilovic
in 2008 for the Hall A BigBite Spectrometer -- changes are significant and
ongoing.
