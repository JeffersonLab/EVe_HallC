EVe_HallC is an event display program for the Hall C HMS detector stack.

The BetheHeitler branch contains geometry changes to match the Bethe Heitler
setup at HIGS.

=== Contributions ===
If you wish to contribute, please fork this repo and following the 'install'
instructions outlined in the Docs/ directory.

Contributions/changes to the EVe_HallC repo will follow the same development
model as for the Hall C analyzer (hcana) outlined here:
  https://hallcweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/Analyzer/Git#Setup_and_creating_a_personal_fork_of_the_analyzer

They boil down to this:
  ** Do not edit files in the develop or master branches **
  - merge upstream/develop into your develop branch
  - make a new 'feature' branch off of develop and work on your changes
    - please make frequent 'atomic' commits with useful commit logs!
    - test your code
  - when your feature is "done"
    - git merge origin/develop     # make sure you are still compatible 
                                   # with any recent upstream changes
    - git push origin <featurebranchname>
  - make a 'pull request' from <featurebranchname> on github

=== Documentation ===
Some documentation may be found in the Docs/ directory, however it has not
kept pace with some of the modifications so YMMV.

=== Acknowledgments ===
This code is based off an event display originally written by Miha Mihovilovic
in 2008 for the Hall A BigBite Spectrometer -- changes are significant and
ongoing.  See 'git log' for the history.
